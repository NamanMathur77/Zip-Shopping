## Prerequisite
1> An android device with android version 4.4 or above.

## Getting Started
Just go to Play Store and type Zip Shopping and install the application.[Tap me to install via Play Store.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=shop.nmnapplications.com.zipshopping)

## Why use Zip Shopping?
There are a lot of shopping websites in the market for buying stuffs you need but you cannot have application for all the shopping portals as the space in your smart phone is limited, so the solution comes in the form of a single application Zip Shopping.

This application can open all the shopping sites and one can compare the same product on different shopping portals.

## Future Plan
I have plan to create a chat option, so buyers can discuss with others, about the products. Also I have plan to introduce TabView so users can simultaneously open two or three sites with same product it would be easy for them to compare.
